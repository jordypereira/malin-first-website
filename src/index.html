            Norwegian Malin Mertens studied at Barratt Due Institute of Music in Oslo under Kari
            Ravnan and
            Ole Eirik Ree, followed by a master's degree with Louisa Tuck with final examination in 2019. While
            studying, she was active as a musician
            and has performed with several professional ensembles and orchestras, including the Oslo
            Philharmonic, Norwegian Opera & Ballet, the
            Norwegian Radio Orchestra and the Trondheim Symphony Orchestra. During this time she was lucky to play on a
            cello lent by Dextra Musica. After her master's degree she worked one year with the Royal Stockholm
            Philharmonic Orchestra as an orchestra academist. Since fall 2020 she is working as a full-time freelance
            cellist based in Oslo, Norway.
